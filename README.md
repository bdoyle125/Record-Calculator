# Record-Calculator

This simple program takes a win/loss record and calculates the percentage of wins you have.

You can also add wins and losses on top of the ones you currently have to make quick record calculations without the use of a calculator.

I primarily use this program when keeping track of a group of friends' predictions of all the games from the NFL season.
